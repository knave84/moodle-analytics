This MS Excel tool analyzes a Moodle log file, producing useful analytics for academics and tutors

Hi all,
My name is Andreas and I am the author of the paper: “Using Excel Macros to Analyse Moodle Logs” from the #MRC2013.

In collaboration with my colleague Cat Grafton, we developed this tool at King's College London to assist academics and staff with analyzing the log files of their Moodle installations.

This tool is very popular and I continually receive requests for access from academics in insitutions around the world: the US, South America, Australia and others. 

Currently the tool supports Moodle versions: 2.6 and older, 2.8 and 3.0.

You can find download the tool and access more information and resources here:

Please get in touch if you'd like to assist me in increasing the tool's functionality and capabilities.
